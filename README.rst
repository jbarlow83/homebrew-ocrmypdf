`OCRmyPDF <https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF>`_ is now officially part of Homebrew. Please use the official version instead of this private tap.

        brew install ocrmypdf

If you previously installed OCRmyPDF from this tap please switch to the Homebrew version:

.. code::

	brew untap jbarlow83/ocrmypdf
	brew reinstall ocrmypdf

If the Homebrew version is not working for you, or if you prefer to not use Homebrew, try the `manual installation procedure for macOS <https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#manual-installation-on-macos>`_ . If you want to install OCRmyPDF and you are not a macOS user, `see the installation manual <https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_. 

This tap is now archived. If you have issues with installing OCRmyPDF with Homebrew, follow the Homebrew troubleshooting guide. If you have issues with how OCRmyPDF works, report them at the `main OCRmyPDF repository <https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF>`_.
