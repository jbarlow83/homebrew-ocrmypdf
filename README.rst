`OCRmyPDF <https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF>`_ is now officially part of Homebrew. Please use the official version instead of this private tap. 

.. code::

        brew install ocrmypdf
	
If you previously installed OCRmyPDF from this tap please switch to the Homebrew version:

.. code::

	brew untap jbarlow83/ocrmypdf
	brew reinstall ocrmypdf

If the homebrew version is not working for you, or if you prefer to not use homebrew, try the `manual installation procedure for macOS <https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#manual-installation-on-macos>`_ .

(This tap is now only used for testing.)
